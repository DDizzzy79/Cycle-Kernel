---- **A iot Bike sytem based on RaspberryPi, Ardiuino, etc**  
## 0x1 What is This?
Cyclic 's Kernel is an independent System With self-producing energy, iot Web control, By the time that this is wrote, The system 's Energy source is a 12V6W Generater and The Voltage, Current is not cocerned, Now, I will introduce those stuff to You
[Plan.pdf](https://github.com/DDizzzy79/ScienceFair/files/7633868/default.pdf)  
Also, as a extra info, Lots of our code is based on lots of thoughts on internet
## 0x2 Basic plans
Our plan That we wanted to inclues are:  
* Generater
* Clock(Shows Volocity&Time)
* Controled turing light
* Energy Store Device
* Other IOT Devices
# Generaters
For our Generaters, We selected A **12V6WGenerater** For out Power source , So Far, The maximum of it is aboat ``5~6V``  
But, We were not exclude That the generater can generate above 6V, So far, The generater 's voltage output exceed our's minimum request.

We chose to install it on the wire of the tire It work pretty well, We can get 5~6v of voltage during a normal ride.
