---- **A iot Bike sytem based on RaspberryPi, Ardiuino, etc**  
## 0x1 What is This?
Cyclic 's Kernel is an independent System With self-producing energy, iot Web control, By the time that this is wrote, The system 's Energy source is a 12V6W Generater and The Voltage, Current is not cocerned, Now, I will introduce those stuff to You
[Plan.pdf](https://github.com/DDizzzy79/ScienceFair/files/7633868/default.pdf)  
Also, as a extra info, Lots of our code is based on lots of thoughts on internet
## 0x2 Basic plans
Our plan That we wanted to inclues are:  
* Generater
* Clock(Shows Volocity&Time)
* Controled turing light
* Energy Store Device
* Other IOT Devices
# Generaters
For our Generaters, We selected A **12V6WGenerater** For out Power source , So Far, The maximum of it is aboat ``5 ~ 6V``  
But, We were not exclude That the generater can generate above 6V, So far, The generater 's voltage output exceed our's minimum request.  
## Installing it

We chose to install it one the wire of the tire
